# dataset-bistable-resp
This repository contains preprocessed respiration and eye tracking data that were recorded in a perceptual reversal paradigm using the Necker cube. Besides the processed data, the main analysis script (Matlab) and all included costumized functions are stored.

Code sections including permutation testing are commented, and the resulting variables are added to the repository as well to ensure shorter running times and the reproduction of figures as displayed in this preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.28.691130
